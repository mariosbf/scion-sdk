//! Path scoring is the central component of path selection.
//!
//! Each path is scored based on multiple metrics, and the scores are aggregated to form a final
//! score. Higher scores indicate more preferred paths.
//!
//! The scoring system is designed to be extensible, allowing new scoring metrics to be added as
//! needed. Scores from multiple metrics can be weighted to reflect their relative importance in
//! path selection.
