//! The HTTP/3-over-SCION client.
//!
//! [`Http3Client`] is the entry point: a cheap-to-construct handle that lazily
//! establishes a connection on the first
//! [`request`](Http3Client::request) and transparently
//! re-establishes it if it breaks (**lazy reconnect**).
//! [`request`](Http3Client::request) sends the request headers
//! and returns a [`RequestBodyWriter`] the caller drives to stream the request
//! body, plus a [`ResponseFut`] that resolves to an `http::Response` whose body
//! is a streaming [`H3ResponseBody`] once the response head arrives.
//!
//! HTTP/3 places no ordering between the request and response bodies, the caller
//! must drive the two concurrently (typically by sending the body from a spawned
//! task while awaiting/reading the response).
//!
//! This is the client counterpart of
//! [`Http3Server`](crate::h3::server::Http3Server), built on the same
//! [`QuicScionApplication`](crate::app::QuicScionApplication) /
//! [`ConnectionHandle`] machinery. The per-connection internals are private
//! submodules: the driver engine (`app`) that routes responses, the connection
//! bootstrap and its ingress loop (`connect`), and an open request stream with
//! its two halves (`stream`). Only the types above are part of
//! the API.
